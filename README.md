## The Brief

Implement a small microservice that will interact with the upload service. Its purpose is to store, and surface through a restful API , attributes that have been uploaded, both meta details about the file and custom attributes. The application can be written in a language of your choice but should include unit test coverage and a comprehensive readme to understand how to run, deploy and get started with the solution.
